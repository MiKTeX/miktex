LICENSE

The gSOAP 2.8.0 (and 2.8.x updates) software is distributed under:

1) The gSOAP Public License 1.3 (which is based on the Mozilla public license
   1.1).
   
   Components NOT covered by the gSOAP Public License are:
   - wsdl2h tool AND its source code output, 
   - soapcpp2 tool AND its source code output,
   - UDDI code,
   - the webserver example code in gsoap/samples/webserver,
   - several example applications in the gsoap/samples directory.

   For details, see the note down below. The gSOAP public license is included
   in the package as license.pdf

2) GPL v2 (GNU Public License, a common open-source software license) covers
   all of the gSOAP software.

   If you use gSOAP under the GPL v2 to integrate parts of it or code generated
   by it with your own code, then you are allowed to sell copies of the
   modified program commercially, but only under the terms of the GNU GPL v2.
   Thus, for instance, you must make the source code of your programs available
   to the users of your programs as described in the GPL, and they must be
   allowed to redistribute and modify it as described in the GPL. These
   requirements are the condition for including the GPL-covered code you
   received in a program of your own.
 
   If you do not wish for your program to be released under a GPL-compatible
   open source license, then an alternate proprietary software license for
   gSOAP which will remove the aforementioned requirement is available from
   Genivia Inc, see 3) below.

   For more information on the GNU Public License 2.0, please visit:
   http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html

   We do not accept third-party GPL contributions to avoid having to fork the
   code base in GPL and non-GPL.

3) Proprietary commercial software development licenses for the standard
   commercial edition and for enterprise-level licensing. The standard edition
   is identical to the open source version of gSOAP and includes all software
   components, but without the open source GPL licensing requirements for your
   project.

IMPORTANT NOTE

Please check the suitability of GPL v2 for your project. Requirements imposed
by the GPL v2 may affect the release of your software.

If you use gSOAP under the GPL v2 to integrate parts of it or code generated
by it with your own code, then you are allowed to sell copies of the modified
program commercially, but only under the terms of the GNU GPL v2. Thus, for
instance, you must make the source code available to the users of the program
as described in the GPL, and they must be allowed to redistribute and modify
it as described in the GPL. These requirements are the condition for including
the GPL-covered code you received in a program of your own. These
restrictions may hamper certain proprietary software development scenarios.
If you do not wish for your program to be released under a GPL-compatible open
source license, then an alternate proprietary software license for gSOAP which
will remove the aforementioned requirement is available from Genivia Inc.

The gSOAP software does not include any third-party GPL code. All software was
written from the ground up since 2003 and is owned and copyrighted by Genivia
Inc. This allows Genivia to dual license the gSOAP software under GPLv2 and
under the Genivia commercial-use licenses.

The Ohloh site by Black Duck includes an analysis of the gSOAP GPLv2 open
source repository:

Please note that "Black Duck Scans" will detect the use of GPL gSOAP software
in your project builds when you are using the gSOAP source code. The
commercial-use licenses by Genivia explicitly grant the use of the gSOAP
software for non-GPL use and inclusion.

Note that the GNU Bison and Flex tools are used to generate source code for the
gSOAP soapcpp2 compiler. The Bison/Flex-generated source code is not restricted
by the GPL or LGPL terms for this particular use.

Non-GPL third-party contributions are included in the 'extras' directory in the
package and you are free to use these contributions. Suggested changes and
improvements by vendors were accepted under the public gSOAP license (not
GPL), which includes support for VxWorks and Apache and IIS modules for gSOAP.
