/* If |b| != |c|, puts the number of canceled bits when one subtracts |c|
   from |b| in *cancel. Returns the sign of the difference (-1, 0, 1).

   Assumes neither of b or c is NaN, +/- infinity, or +/- 0.

   In other terms, if |b| != |c|, mpfr_cmp2 (b, c) stores
   EXP(max(|b|,|c|)) - EXP(|b| - |c|) in *cancel.

   One necessarily has 0 <= cancel <= max(PREC(b),PREC(c)), so that this
   value is representable in a mpfr_prec_t. Note that in the code, the
   maximum intermediate value is cancel + 1, but since MPFR_PREC_MAX is
   not the maximum value of mpfr_prec_t, there is no integer overflow.
