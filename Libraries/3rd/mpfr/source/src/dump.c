#include "mpfr-impl.h"

/* mpfr_dump is mainly for debugging purpose. It outputs a MPFR number
 * in some unspecified format, then a newline character. This function
 * is part of the API, but the output format may change without breaking
 * the ABI.
 *
 * Since this is for debugging, it can detect invalid data (or UBF), and
 * in such a case, it outputs information between exclamation marks:
 *   - 'N': the number is not normalized (MSB = 0);
 *   - 'T': there are non-zero trailing bits (output in square brackets);
 *   - 'U': this is an UBF number (internal use only);
 *   - '<': the exponent is < the current emin;
 *   - '>': the exponent is > the current emax.
 *
 * The format may depend on MPFR_* environment variables. For instance,
 * in the future, some environment variables could specify prefix and
 * suffix strings to colorize parts of the output that correspond to
 * invalid data.
