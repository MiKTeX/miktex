/* "double" NaN and infinities are written as explicit bytes to be sure of
   getting what we want, and to be sure of not depending on libm.

   Could use 4-byte "float" values and let the code convert them, but it
   seems more direct to give exactly what we want.  Certainly for gcc 3.0.2
   on alphaev56-unknown-freebsd4.3 the NaN must be 8-bytes, since that
   compiler+system was seen incorrectly converting from a "float" NaN.  */

/* For NaN, we use DBL_NAN since the memory representation of a NaN depends
   on the processor: a fixed memory representation could yield either a
   quiet NaN (qNaN) or a signaling NaN (sNaN). For instance, HP PA-RISC
   is known to do the opposite way of the usual choice recommended in
   IEEE 754-2008; see:
     https://grouper.ieee.org/groups/1788/email/msg03272.html

   Moreover, the right choice is to generate a qNaN in particular because
   signaling NaNs are not supported by all compilers (note that the support
   must be in the compiler used to build the user-end application because
   this is where the sNaN will be obtained). */
