/* The mpfr_urandom() function is implemented in the following way,
   so that the exact number (the random value to be rounded) and the
   final status of the random generator do not depend on the current
   exponent range and on the rounding mode. However, they depend on
   the target precision: from the same state of the random generator,
   if the precision of the destination is changed, then the value may
   be completely different (and the state of the random generator is
   different too).
   1. One determines the exponent exp: 0 with probability 1/2, -1 with
      probability 1/4, -2 with probability 1/8, etc.
   2. One draws a 1-ulp interval ]a,b[ containing the exact result (the
      interval can be regarded as open since it has the same measure as
      the closed interval).
      One also draws the rounding bit. This is currently done with a
      separate call to mpfr_rand_raw(), but it should be better to draw
      the rounding bit as part of the significand; there is space for it
      since the MSB is always 1.
   3. Rounding is done. For the directed rounding modes, the rounded value
      is uniquely determined. For rounding to nearest, ]a,m[ and ]m,b[,
      where m = (a+b)/2, have the same measure, so that one gets a or b
      with equal probabilities.
