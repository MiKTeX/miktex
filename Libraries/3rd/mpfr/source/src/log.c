/* The computation of log(x) is done using the formula :
     if we want p bits of the result,

                       pi
          log(x) ~ ------------  -   m log 2
                    2 AG(1,4/s)

     where s = x 2^m > 2^(p/2)

     More precisely, if F(x) = int(1/sqrt(1-(1-x^2)*sin(t)^2), t=0..PI/2),
     then for s>=1.26 we have log(s) < F(4/s) < log(s)*(1+4/s^2)
     from which we deduce pi/2/AG(1,4/s)*(1-4/s^2) < log(s) < pi/2/AG(1,4/s)
     so the relative error 4/s^2 is < 4/2^p i.e. 4 ulps.
