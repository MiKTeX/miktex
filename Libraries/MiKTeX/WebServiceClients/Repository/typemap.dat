#	typemap.dat

#	Use this file to define namespace prefix and type bindings for
#	the generated header files by the 'wsdl2h' tool.  typemap.dat is the
#	default file processed by 'wsdl2h' to customize its output. You can use
#	wsdl2h option -t to specify an alternate file.

#######	XML NAMESPACE BINDINGS

#	XML namespace prefix bindings can be provided to override the default
#	choice of the ns1, ns2, ... prefixes generated by wsdl2h.  It is highly
#	recommended to provide namespace prefixes for your project's XML
#	namespaces. In this way, changes to the WSDL (or newer releases of
#	wsdl2h) will have a minimal impact on coding.
#	Bindings for namespace prefixes are of the form:
#		prefix = "URI"

#######	XSD TYPE BINDINGS

#	Type bindings can be provided to bind XML schema types to C/C++
#	types for your project.
#	Type bindings are of the form:
#		prefix__type = declaration | use | ptr-use
#	where 'prefix__type' is the C/C++-translation of the schema type,
#	'declaration' introduces the type in the header file, the optional
#	'use' specifies how the type is used directly, and the optional
#	'ptr-use' specifies how the type is used as a pointer type.
#	For example, to use wide stirngs in C:
#		xsd__string = | wchar_t* | wchar_t*
#	which replaced the default char* mapping in C of xsd:string.
#	To use C++ std::wstring for xsd:string:
#		xsd__string = | std::wstring
#	After enabling one of these lines, all XSD strings will be remapped.
#	Note that the 'declaration' part is empty in these case as expected.
#
#	When a type binding requires only the usage to be changed and the
#	declaration part must be kept intact, then the declaration part can be
#	replaced by elipsis ..., as in:
#		prefix__type = ... | use | ptr-use
#	This ensure that the wsdl2h-generated type definition is preserved,
#	while the use and ptr-use are remapped.
#	For example, this is useful to map schema polymorphic types to C types,
#	where we need to be able to both handle a base type and its extensions
#	as per schema extensibility. Say base type ns:base allows derived
#	extensions and we need to map this to C types as follows:
#		ns__base = ... | int __type_base; void*
#	where __type_base and void* are used to (de)serialize any data type,
#	including base and its derived types.

#######	CLASS/STRUCT MEMBER ADDITIONS

#	Additional data and function members can be provided to extend a
#	wsdl2h-generated struct or class.
#	Class and struct extensions are of the form:
#		prefix__type = $ member-declaration
#	For example, to add a constructor and destructor to class myns__record:
#		myns__record = $ myns__record();
#		myns__record = $ ~myns__record();

#######	TYPE EQUIVALENCES

#	Type equivalence mappings can be given to map a type to another type:
#		prefix__type1 == prefix__type2
#	which replaces 'prefix__type1' by 'prefix__type2' in the wsdl2h output.
#	For example:
#		SOAP_ENC__boolean == xsd__boolean
#	which replaces 'SOAP_ENC__boolean' with the C/C++ type information that
#	corresponds to `xsd__boolean' which is 'bool' for C++.
#	Target C/C++ type names (names without prefix) can also be replaced:
#		float == double
#	which replaces all 'float' with 'double' in the wsdl2h output. Beware
#	that replacement types may lead to xsi:type mismatches and SOAP
#	encoding id-ref mismatches when parsing inbound XML messages.

#######	BUILT-IN VARIABLES

#	The variable '$CONTAINER' defines the container to emit in the
#	generated declarations, which is std::vector by default.
#	For example:
#		$CONTAINER = std::list
#	The variable '$POINTER' defines the smart pointer to emit in the
#	generated declarations, replacing '*'. For example:
#		$POINTER = std::shared_ptr
#	Not all pointers in the generated output can be replaced by smart
#	pointers when standard pointers are used as union members and pointers
#	to arrays.

#######	USER-DEFINED CONTENT

#	Any other content to be included in the generated header file can be
#	provided by enclosing it within brackets [ and ]. These brackets MUST
#	appear at the start of a new line.
#	For example, to add an #import directive to the wsdl2h-generated output:
#       [
#       #import "wsa5.h"
#       ]

#	Remember: type bindings are given on a single line (use \ to continue
#	with the next line). Here is an example binding for the XSD int type
#	that maps to an 'int':
# xsd__int	= | int

#	To use regular char* strings instead of std::string, use:
# xsd__string	= | char* | char*

#	For char* serialized with xsi:type when using soapcpp2 option -t, use:
# xsd__string	= typedef char *xsd__string; | xsd__string | xsd__string

#	The following mapping is internally applied by wsdl2h for C (not C++):
#	(assuming option -e is used to remove the xsd__boolean__ name prefix)
# xsd__boolean	= enum xsd__boolean { false_, true_ }; | enum xsd__boolean

#	Uncomment the line below to use __int128_t for xsd:integer instead of
#	mapping xsd:integer to string.
#	Must compile and link custom/int128.c with the project.
# xsd__integer = #import "custom/int128.h" | xsd__integer
#	Or if the xsd:integer value range is bounded to int64_t, then:
# xsd__integer = typedef int64_t xsd__integer;

#	Uncomment the line below to use long double for xsd:decimal instead of
#	mapping xsd:decimal to string.
#	Must compile and link custom/long_double.c with the project.
# xsd__decimal = #import "custom/long_double.h" | long double
#	Or if your system supports __float128 then you can use:
# xsd__decimal = #import "custom/float128.h" | xsd__decimal
#	Or if the xsd:decimal value range is bounded to double, then:
# xsd__decimal = typedef double xsd__decimal;

#	Uncomment the line below to use struct tm instead of time_t xsd:dateTime
#	Must compile and link custom/struct_tm.c with the project.
# xsd__dateTime = #import "custom/struct_tm.h" | xsd__dateTime

#	Uncomment the line below to use timeval with usec precision xsd:dateTime
#	Must compile and link custom/struct_timeval.c with the project.
# xsd__dateTime = #import "custom/struct_timeval.h" | xsd__dateTime

#	Uncomment the line below to use std::chrono::system_clock::time_point
#	for xsd:dateTime.
#	Must compile and link custom/chrono_time_point.c with the project.
# xsd__dateTime = #import "custom/chrono_time_point.h" | xsd__dateTime

#	Uncomment the line below to use struct tm for xsd:date instead of
#	mapping xsd:date to string.
#	Must compile and link custom/struct_tm_date.c with the project.
# xsd__date = #import "custom/struct_tm_date.h" | xsd__date

#	Uncomment the line below to use LONG64 int for xsd:duration instead of
#	mapping xsd:duration to string (in milliseconds precision).
#	Must compile and link custom/duration.c with the project.
xsd__duration = #import "custom/duration.h" | xsd__duration

#	Uncomment the line below to use C++11 std::chrono::nanoseconds for
#	xsd:duration instead of mapping xsd:duration to string.
#	Must compile and link custom/chrono_duration.cpp with the project.
# xsd__duration = #import "custom/chrono_duration.h" | xsd__duration

#	Uncomment the line below to use ULONG64 int for xsd:time instead of
#	mapping xsd:time to string (also comes with high usec precision)
#	Must compile and link custom/time.c with the project.
# xsd__time = #import "custom/long_time.h" | xsd__time

#	When compiling WITH_LEAN there is no hexBinary serializer. You can
#	remap the hexBinary type to a string as follows:
# xsd__hexBinary = | char*

#	When wsdl2h option -d is used, xsd:any is mapped to xsd__anyType DOM
#	declared in dom.h and implemented in dom.c/dom.cpp. You can remap
#	xsd:any, for example to a pointer to a DOM node as follows:
# xsd__any = | xsd__anyType*

#	When SOAP 1.2 Faults should carry multiple SOAP_ENV__Text elements with
#	xml:lang attributes, then remap SOAP_ENV__Reason as follows:
# [
# struct SOAP_ENV__Reason
# {
#   char *SOAP_ENV__Text; // at least one SOAP-ENV:Text for the gSOAP engine
#   $int size;
#   struct SOAP_ENV__Text *SOAP_ENV__Text_; // array of more SOAP-ENV:Text
# }; 
# struct SOAP_ENV__Text
# {
#   char *__item;
#   @char *xml__lang;
# };
# ]

#	SOAP-ENV mapping (note: SOAP Body content is mapped to an XML string)

SOAP_ENV__Envelope	= struct SOAP_ENV__Envelope { struct SOAP_ENV__Header *SOAP_ENV__Header; _XML SOAP_ENV__Body; }; | struct SOAP_ENV__Envelope
SOAP_ENV__Header	= | struct SOAP_ENV__Header
