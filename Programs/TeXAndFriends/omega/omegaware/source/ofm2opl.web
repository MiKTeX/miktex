@* Introduction.
The \.{OFM2OPL} utility program converts $\Omega$ and \TeX\ font
metric (``\.{TFM}'' and ``\.{OFM}'') files into equivalent
property-list (``\.{PL}'' and ``\.{OPL}'') files. It also
makes a thorough check of the given \.{TFM} or \.{OFM} file,
using essentially the same algorithm as \TeX\ or $\Omega$. Thus
if \TeX\ or $\Omega$ complains that a \.{TFM} or an \.{OFM}
file is ``bad,'' this program will pinpoint the source or sources of
badness. A \.{PL} or \.{OPL} file output by this program can be edited
with a normal text editor, and the result can be converted back to \.{TFM}
or \.{OFM} format using the companion program \.{OPLtoOFM}.

The first \.{TFtoPL} program was designed by Leo Guibas in the summer of
1978. Contributions by Frank Liang, Doug Wyatt, and Lyle Ramshaw
also had a significant effect on the evolution of the present code.

Extensions for an enhanced ligature mechanism were added by
D. E. Knuth in 1989.

Extensions to handle extended font metric files (``\.{OFM}'') were
added by John Plaice in December 1995 and January 1996, resulting in
the new program \.{OFM2OPL}.  In the following documentation, all
unchanged references to the \.{TFtoPL} program and to \.{TFM} and
\.{PL} files also apply to the \.{OFM2OPL} program and to \.{OFM}
and \.{OPL} files.

The |banner| string defined here should be changed whenever \.{OFM2OPL}
gets modified.

@d banner=='This is OFM2OPL, Version 1.11'

@ This program is written entirely in standard \PASCAL, except that
it occasionally has lower case letters in strings that are output.
Such letters can be converted to upper case if necessary. The input is read
from |tfm_file|, and the output is written on |pl_file|; error messages and
other remarks are written on the |output| file, which the user may
choose to assign to the terminal if the system permits it.
@^system dependencies@>

The term |print| is used instead of |write| when this program writes on
the |output| file, so that all such output can be easily deflected.

@* Font metric data.
The following description of \.{TFM} files is not sufficient for
\.{OFM} files.  The additional documentation necessary for the 
\.{OFM} files can be found in another file, such as the $\Omega$
change files.

The idea behind \.{TFM} files is that typesetting routines like \TeX\
need a compact way to store the relevant information about several
dozen fonts, and computer centers need a compact way to store the
relevant information about several hundred fonts. \.{TFM} files are
compact, and most of the information they contain is highly relevant,
so they provide a solution to the problem.

The information in a \.{TFM} file appears in a sequence of 8-bit bytes.
Since the number of bytes is always a multiple of 4, we could
also regard the file as a sequence of 32-bit words; but \TeX\ uses the
byte interpretation, and so does \.{TFtoPL}. Note that the bytes
are considered to be unsigned numbers.

@<Glob...@>=
@!tfm_file:packed file of 0..255;

@ On some systems you may have to do something special to read a
packed file of bytes. For example, the following code didn't work
when it was first tried at Stanford, because packed files have to be
opened with a special switch setting on the \PASCAL\ that was used.
@^system dependencies@>

@<Set init...@>=
reset(tfm_file);

@ The first 24 bytes (6 words) of a \.{TFM} file contain twelve 16-bit
integers that give the lengths of the various subsequent portions
of the file. These twelve integers are, in order:
$$\vbox{\halign{\hfil#&$\null=\null$#\hfil\cr
|@!lf|&length of the entire file, in words;\cr
|@!lh|&length of the header data, in words;\cr
|@!bc|&smallest character code in the font;\cr
|@!ec|&largest character code in the font;\cr
|@!nw|&number of words in the width table;\cr
|@!nh|&number of words in the height table;\cr
|@!nd|&number of words in the depth table;\cr
|@!ni|&number of words in the italic correction table;\cr
|@!nl|&number of words in the lig/kern table;\cr
|@!nk|&number of words in the kern table;\cr
|@!ne|&number of words in the extensible character table;\cr
|@!np|&number of font parameter words.\cr}}$$
They are all nonnegative and less than $2^{15}$. We must have |bc-1<=ec<=255|,
|ne<=256|, and
$$\hbox{|lf=6+lh+(ec-bc+1)+nw+nh+nd+ni+nl+nk+ne+np|.}$$
Note that a font may contain as many as 256 characters (if |bc=0| and |ec=255|),
and as few as 0 characters (if |bc=ec+1|).

Incidentally, when two or more 8-bit bytes are combined to form an integer of
16 or more bits, the most significant bytes appear first in the file.
This is called BigEndian order.

@ The rest of the \.{TFM} file may be regarded as a sequence of ten data
arrays having the informal specification
$$\def\arr$[#1]#2${\&{array} $[#1]$ \&{of} #2}
\vbox{\halign{\hfil\\{#}&$\,:\,$\arr#\hfil\cr
header&|[0..lh-1]stuff|\cr
char\_info&|[bc..ec]char_info_word|\cr
width&|[0..nw-1]fix_word|\cr
height&|[0..nh-1]fix_word|\cr
depth&|[0..nd-1]fix_word|\cr

kern&|[0..nk-1]fix_word|\cr
exten&|[0..ne-1]extensible_recipe|\cr
param&|[1..np]fix_word|\cr}}$$
The most important data type used here is a |@!fix_word|, which is
a 32-bit representation of a binary fraction. A |fix_word| is a signed
quantity, with the two's complement of the entire word used to represent
negation. Of the 32 bits in a |fix_word|, exactly 12 are to the left of the
binary point; thus, the largest |fix_word| value is $2048-2^{-20}$, and
the smallest is $-2048$. We will see below, however, that all but one of
the |fix_word| values will lie between $-16$ and $+16$.

@ The first data array is a block of header information, which contains
general facts about the font. The header must contain at least two words,
and for \.{TFM} files to be used with Xerox printing software it must
contain at least 18 words, allocated as described below. When different
kinds of devices need to be interfaced, it may be necessary to add further
words to the header block.

\yskip\hang|header[0]| is a 32-bit check sum that \TeX\ will copy into the
\.{DVI} output file whenever it uses the font.  Later on when the \.{DVI}
file is printed, possibly on another computer, the actual font that gets
used is supposed to have a check sum that agrees with the one in the
\.{TFM} file used by \TeX. In this way, users will be warned about
potential incompatibilities. (However, if the check sum is zero in either
the font file or the \.{TFM} file, no check is made.)  The actual relation
between this check sum and the rest of the \.{TFM} file is not important;
the check sum is simply an identification number with the property that
incompatible fonts almost always have distinct check sums.
@^check sum@>

\yskip\hang|header[1]| is a |fix_word| containing the design size of the
font, in units of \TeX\ points (7227 \TeX\ points = 254 cm).  This number
must be at least 1.0; it is fairly arbitrary, but usually the design size
is 10.0 for a ``10 point'' font, i.e., a font that was designed to look
best at a 10-point size, whatever that really means. When a \TeX\ user
asks for a font `\.{at} $\delta$ \.{pt}', the effect is to override the
design size and replace it by $\delta$, and to multiply the $x$ and~$y$
coordinates of the points in the font image by a factor of $\delta$
divided by the design size.  {\sl All other dimensions in the\/\ \.{TFM}
file are |fix_word|\kern-1pt\ numbers in design-size units.} Thus, for example,
the value of |param[6]|, one \.{em} or \.{\\quad}, is often the |fix_word|
value $2^{20}=1.0$, since many fonts have a design size equal to one em.
The other dimensions must be less than 16 design-size units in absolute
value; thus, |header[1]| and |param[1]| are the only |fix_word| entries in
the whole \.{TFM} file whose first byte might be something besides 0 or
255.  @^design size@>

\yskip\hang|header[2..11]|, if present, contains 40 bytes that identify
the character coding scheme. The first byte, which must be between 0 and
39, is the number of subsequent ASCII bytes actually relevant in this
string, which is intended to specify what character-code-to-symbol
convention is present in the font.  Examples are \.{ASCII} for standard
ASCII, \.{TeX text} for fonts like \.{cmr10} and \.{cmti9}, \.{TeX math
extension} for \.{cmex10}, \.{XEROX text} for Xerox fonts, \.{GRAPHIC} for
special-purpose non-alphabetic fonts, \.{UNSPECIFIED} for the default case
when there is no information.  Parentheses should not appear in this name.
(Such a string is said to be in {\mc BCPL} format.)
@^coding scheme@>

\yskip\hang|header[12..16]|, if present, contains 20 bytes that name the
font family (e.g., \.{CMR} or \.{HELVETICA}), in {\mc BCPL} format.
This field is also known as the ``font identifier.''
@^family name@>
@^font identifier@>

\yskip\hang|header[17]|, if present, contains a first byte called the
|seven_bit_safe_flag|, then two bytes that are ignored, and a fourth byte
called the |face|. If the value of the fourth byte is less than 18, it has
the following interpretation as a ``weight, slope, and expansion'':  Add 0
or 2 or 4 (for medium or bold or light) to 0 or 1 (for roman or italic) to
0 or 6 or 12 (for regular or condensed or extended).  For example, 13 is
0+1+12, so it represents medium italic extended.  A three-letter code
(e.g., \.{MIE}) can be used for such |face| data.

\yskip\hang|header[18..@twhatever@>]| might also be present; the individual
words are simply called |header[18]|, |header[19]|, etc., at the moment.

@ Next comes the |char_info| array, which contains one |char_info_word|
per character. Each |char_info_word| contains six fields packed into
four bytes as follows.

\yskip\hang first byte: |width_index| (8 bits)\par
\hang second byte: |height_index| (4 bits) times 16, plus |depth_index|
  (4~bits)\par
\hang third byte: |italic_index| (6 bits) times 4, plus |tag|
  (2~bits)\par
\hang fourth byte: |remainder| (8 bits)\par
\yskip\noindent
The actual width of a character is |width[width_index]|, in design-size
units; this is a device for compressing information, since many characters
have the same width. Since it is quite common for many characters
to have the same height, depth, or italic correction, the \.{TFM} format
imposes a limit of 16 different heights, 16 different depths, and
64 different italic corrections.

Incidentally, the relation |width[0]=height[0]=depth[0]=italic[0]=0|
should always hold, so that an index of zero implies a value of zero.
The |width_index| should never be zero unless the character does
not exist in the font, since a character is valid if and only if it lies
between |bc| and |ec| and has a nonzero |width_index|.

@ The |tag| field in a |char_info_word| has four values that explain how to
interpret the |remainder| field.

\yskip\hang|tag=0| (|no_tag|) means that |remainder| is unused.\par
\hang|tag=1| (|lig_tag|) means that this character has a ligature/kerning
program starting at |lig_kern[remainder]|.\par
\hang|tag=2| (|list_tag|) means that this character is part of a chain of
characters of ascending sizes, and not the largest in the chain.  The
|remainder| field gives the character code of the next larger character.\par
\hang|tag=3| (|ext_tag|) means that this character code represents an
extensible character, i.e., a character that is built up of smaller pieces
so that it can be made arbitrarily large. The pieces are specified in
|exten[remainder]|.\par

@d no_tag=0 {vanilla character}
@d lig_tag=1 {character has a ligature/kerning program}
@d list_tag=2 {character has a successor in a charlist}
@d ext_tag=3 {character is extensible}

@ The |lig_kern| array contains instructions in a simple programming language
that explains what to do for special letter pairs. Each word is a
|lig_kern_command| of four bytes.

\yskip\hang first byte: |skip_byte|, indicates that this is the final program
  step if the byte is 128 or more, otherwise the next step is obtained by
  skipping this number of intervening steps.\par
\hang second byte: |next_char|, ``if |next_char| follows the current character,
  then perform the operation and stop, otherwise continue.''\par
\hang third byte: |op_byte|, indicates a ligature step if less than~128,
  a kern step otherwise.\par
\hang fourth byte: |remainder|.\par
\yskip\noindent
In a kern step, an
additional space equal to |kern[256*(op_byte-128)+remainder]| is inserted
between the current character and |next_char|. This amount is
often negative, so that the characters are brought closer together
by kerning; but it might be positive.

There are eight kinds of ligature steps, having |op_byte| codes $4a+2b+c$ where
$0\le a\le b+c$ and $0\le b,c\le1$. The character whose code is
|remainder| is inserted between the current character and |next_char|;
then the current character is deleted if $b=0$, and |next_char| is
deleted if $c=0$; then we pass over $a$~characters to reach the next
current character (which may have a ligature/kerning program of its own).

Notice that if $a=0$ and $b=1$, the current character is unchanged; if
$a=b$ and $c=1$, the current character is changed but the next character is
unchanged. \.{TFtoPL} will check to see that infinite loops are avoided.

If the very first instruction of the |lig_kern| array has |skip_byte=255|,
the |next_char| byte is the so-called right boundary character of this font;
the value of |next_char| need not lie between |bc| and~|ec|.
If the very last instruction of the |lig_kern| array has |skip_byte=255|,
there is a special ligature/kerning program for a left boundary character,
beginning at location |256*op_byte+remainder|.
The interpretation is that \TeX\ puts implicit boundary characters
before and after each consecutive string of characters from the same font.
These implicit characters do not appear in the output, but they can affect
ligatures and kerning.

If the very first instruction of a character's |lig_kern| program has
|skip_byte>128|, the program actually begins in location
|256*op_byte+remainder|. This feature allows access to large |lig_kern|
arrays, because the first instruction must otherwise
appear in a location |<=255|.

Any instruction with |skip_byte>128| in the |lig_kern| array must have
|256*op_byte+remainder<nl|. If such an instruction is encountered during
normal program execution, it denotes an unconditional halt; no ligature
command is performed.

@d stop_flag=128 {value indicating `\.{STOP}' in a lig/kern program}
@d kern_flag=128 {op code for a kern step}

@ Extensible characters are specified by an |extensible_recipe|,
which consists of four bytes called |top|, |mid|,
|bot|, and |rep| (in this order). These bytes are the character codes
of individual pieces used to build up a large symbol.
If |top|, |mid|, or |bot| are zero,
they are not present in the built-up result. For example, an extensible
vertical line is like an extensible bracket, except that the top and
bottom pieces are missing.


@ The final portion of a \.{TFM} file is the |param| array, which is another
sequence of |fix_word| values.

\yskip\hang|param[1]=@!slant| is the amount of italic slant, which is used
to help position accents. For example, |slant=.25| means that when you go
up one unit, you also go .25 units to the right. The |slant| is a pure
number; it's the only |fix_word| other than the design size itself that is
not scaled by the design size.

\hang|param[2]=space| is the normal spacing between words in text.
Note that character |" "| in the font need not have anything to do with
blank spaces.

\hang|param[3]=space_stretch| is the amount of glue stretching between words.

\hang|param[4]=space_shrink| is the amount of glue shrinking between words.

\hang|param[5]=x_height| is the height of letters for which accents don't
have to be raised or lowered.

\hang|param[6]=quad| is the size of one em in the font.

\hang|param[7]=extra_space| is the amount added to |param[2]| at the
ends of sentences.

When the character coding scheme is \.{TeX math symbols}, the font is
supposed to have 15 additional parameters called |num1|, |num2|, |num3|,
|denom1|, |denom2|, |sup1|, |sup2|, |sup3|, |sub1|, |sub2|, |supdrop|,
|subdrop|, |delim1|, |delim2|, and |axis_height|, respectively. When the
character coding scheme is \.{TeX math extension}, the font is supposed to
have six additional parameters called |default_rule_thickness| and
|big_op_spacing1| through |big_op_spacing5|.

@ So that is what \.{TFM} files hold. The next question is, ``What about
\.{PL} files?'' A complete answer to that question appears in the
documentation of the companion program, \.{PLtoTF}, so it will not
be repeated here. Suffice it to say that a \.{PL} file is an ordinary
\PASCAL\ text file, and that the output of \.{TFtoPL} uses only a
subset of the possible constructions that might appear in a \.{PL} file.
Furthermore, hardly anybody really wants to look at the formal
definition of \.{PL} format, because it is almost self-explanatory when
you see an example or two.

@* Basic output subroutines.
Let us now define some procedures that will reduce the rest of \.{TFtoPL}'s

@ In order to stick to standard \PASCAL, we use three strings called
|ASCII_04|, |ASCII_10|, and |ASCII_14|, in terms of which we can do the

@* Doing it.
\TeX\ checks the information of a \.{TFM} file for validity as the
file is being read in, so that no further checks will be needed when
typesetting is going on. And when it finds something wrong, it justs
calls the file ``bad,'' without identifying the nature of the problem,
since \.{TFM} files are supposed to be good almost all of the time.

Of course, a bad file shows up every now and again, and that's where
\.{TFtoPL} comes in. This program wants to catch at least as many errors as
\TeX\ does, and to give informative error messages besides.
All of the errors are corrected, so that the \.{PL} output will
be correct (unless, of course, the \.{TFM} file was so loused up
that no attempt is being made to fathom it).

@ Just before each character is processed, its code is printed in hex
notation. Up to eight such codes appear on a line; so we have a variable
to keep track of how many are currently there. We also keep track of
whether or not any errors have had to be corrected.

@* Checking for ligature loops.
We have programmed almost everything but the most interesting calculation of
all, which has been saved for last as a special treat. \TeX's extended
ligature mechanism allows unwary users to specify sequences of ligature
replacements that never terminate. For example, the pair of commands
$$\.{(/LIG $x$ $y$) (/LIG $y$ $x$)}$$
alternately replaces character $x$ by character $y$ and vice versa. A similar
loop occurs if \.{(LIG/ $z$ $y$)} occurs in the program for $x$ and
 \.{(LIG/ $z$ $x$)} occurs in the program for $y$.

More complicated loops are also possible. For example, suppose the ligature
programs for $x$ and $y$ are
$$\vcenter{\halign{#\hfil\cr
\.{(LABEL $x$)(/LIG/ $z$ $w$)(/LIG/> $w$ $y$)} \dots,\cr
\.{(LABEL $y$)(LIG $w$ $x$)} \dots;\cr}}$$
then the adjacent characters $xz$ change to $xwz$, $xywz$, $xxz$, $xxwz$,
\dots, ad infinitum.

@ To detect such loops, \.{TFtoPL} attempts to evaluate the function
$f(x,y)$ for all character pairs $x$ and~$y$, where $f$ is defined as
follows: If the current character is $x$ and the next character is
$y$, we say the ``cursor'' is between $x$ and $y$; when the cursor
first moves past $y$, the character immediately to its left is
$f(x,y)$. This function is defined if and only if no infinite loop is
generated when the cursor is between $x$ and~$y$.

The function $f(x,y)$ can be defined recursively. It turns out that all pairs
$(x,y)$ belong to one of five classes. The simplest class has $f(x,y)=y$;
this happens if there's no ligature between $x$ and $y$, or in the cases
\.{LIG/>} and \.{/LIG/>>}. Another simple class arises when there's a
\.{LIG} or \.{/LIG>} between $x$ and~$y$, generating the character~$z$;
then $f(x,y)=z$. Otherwise we always have $f(x,y)$ equal to
either $f(x,z)$ or $f(z,y)$ or $f(f(x,z),y)$, where $z$ is the inserted
ligature character.

The first two of these classes can be merged; we can also consider
$(x,y)$ to belong to the simple class when $f(x,y)$ has been evaluated.
For technical reasons we allow $x$ to be 256 (for the boundary character
at the left) or 257 (in cases when an error has been detected).

For each pair $(x,y)$ having a ligature program step, we store
$(x,y)$ in a hash table from which the values $z$ and $class$ can be read.

@d simple=0 {$f(x,y)=z$}
@d left_z=1 {$f(x,y)=f(z,y)$}

@* System-dependent changes.
This section should be replaced, if necessary, by changes to the program
that are necessary to make \.{TFtoPL} work at a particular installation.
It is usually best to design your change file so that all changes to
previous sections preserve the section numbering; then everybody's version
will be consistent with the printed program. More extensive changes,
which introduce new sections, can be inserted here; then only the index
itself will get a new section number.

Pointers to error messages appear here together with the section numbers
where each ident\-i\-fier is used.
