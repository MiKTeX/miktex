The bane of portability is the fact that different operating systems treat input
and output quite differently, perhaps because computer scientists have not given
sufficient attention to this problem. People have felt somehow that input and
output are not part of ``real'' programming. Well, it is true that some kinds of
programming are more fun than others. With existing input/output conventions
being so diverse and so messy, the only sources of joy in such parts of the code
are the rare occasions when one can find a way to make the program a little less
bad than it might have been. We have two choices, either to attack I/O now and
get it over with, or to postpone I/O until near the end. Neither prospect is very
attractive, so let's get it over with.

The basic operations we need to do are (1)~inputting and outputting of text, to
or from a file or the user's terminal; (2)~inputting and outputting of eight-bit
bytes, to or from a file; (3)~instructing the operating system to initiate
(``open'') or to terminate (``close'') input or output from a specified file;
(4)~testing whether the end of an input file has been reached.

\TeX\ needs to deal with two kinds of files. We shall use the term |alpha_file|
for a file that contains textual data, and the term |byte_file| for a file that
contains eight-bit binary information. These two types turn out to be the same on
many computers, but sometimes there is a significant distinction, so we shall be
careful to distinguish between them. Standard protocols for transferring such
files from computer to computer, via high-speed networks, are now becoming
available to more and more communities of users.

The program actually makes use also of a third kind of file, called a
|word_file|, when dumping and reloading base information for its own
initialization. We shall define a word file later; but it will be possible for us
to specify simple operations on word files before they are defined.

We finally did away with |nameoffile| and |namelength|, but the variables have to
be kept otherwise there will be link errors from |openclose.c| in the web2c
library

    When input files are opened via a callback, they will also be read using
    callbacks. for that purpose, the |open_read_file_callback| returns an integer
    to uniquely identify a callback table. This id replaces the file point |f| in
    this case, because the input does not have to be a file in the traditional
    sense.

    Signalling this fact is achieved by having two arrays of integers.

    invasive surgery in libkpathsea.

    Binary input and output are done with C's ordinary procedures, so we don't
    have to make any other special arrangements for binary~I/O. Text output is
    also easy to do with standard routines. The treatment of text input is more
    difficult, however, because of the necessary translation to |ASCII_code|
    values. \TeX's conventions should be efficient, and they should blend nicely
    with the user's operating environment.

    Input from text files is read one line at a time, using a routine called
    |lua_input_ln|. This function is defined in terms of global variables called
    |buffer|, |first|, and |last| that will be described in detail later; for
    now, it suffices for us to know that |buffer| is an array of |ASCII_code|
    values, and that |first| and |last| are indices into this array representing
    the beginning and ending of a line of text.

*/

int max_buf_stack;

/*tex

    The |lua_input_ln| function brings the next line of input from the specified
    file into available positions of the buffer array and returns the value
    |true|, unless the file has already been entirely read, in which case it
    returns |false| and sets |last:=first|. In general, the |ASCII_code| numbers
    that represent the next line of the file are input into |buffer[first]|,
    |buffer[first+1]|, \dots, |buffer[last-1]|; and the global variable |last| is
    set equal to |first| plus the length of the line. Trailing blanks are removed
    from the line; thus, either |last=first| (in which case the line was entirely
    blank) or |buffer[last-1]<>" "|.

    An overflow error is given, however, if the normal actions of |lua_input_ln|
    would make |last>=buf_size|; this is done so that other parts of \TeX\ can
    safely look at the contents of |buffer[last+1]| without overstepping the
    bounds of the |buffer| array. Upon entry to |lua_input_ln|, the condition
    |first<buf_size| will always hold, so that there is always room for an
    ``empty'' line.

    The variable |max_buf_stack|, which is used to keep track of how large the
    |buf_size| parameter must be to accommodate the present job, is also kept up
    to date by |lua_input_ln|.

    If the |bypass_eoln| parameter is |true|, |lua_input_ln| will do a |get|
    before looking at the first character of the line; this skips over an |eoln|
    that was in |f^|. The procedure does not do a |get| when it reaches the end
    of the line; therefore it can be used to acquire input from the user's
    terminal as well as from ordinary text files.

    Since the inner loop of |lua_input_ln| is part of \TeX's ``inner
    loop''---each character of input comes in at this place---it is wise to
    reduce system overhead by making use of special routines that read in an
    entire array of characters at once, if such routines are available.

    We need a special routine to read the first line of \TeX\ input from the
    user's terminal. This line is different because it is read before we have
    opened the transcript file; there is sort of a ``chicken and egg'' problem
    here. If the user types `\.{\\input paper}' on the first line, or if some
    macro invoked by that line does such an \.{\\input}, the transcript file will
    be named `\.{paper.log}'; but if no \.{\\input} commands are performed during
    the first line of terminal input, the transcript file will acquire its
    default name `\.{texput.log}'. (The transcript file will not contain error
    messages generated by the first line before the first \.{\\input} command.)

    The first line is special also because it may be read before \TeX\ has input
    a format file. In such cases, normal error messages cannot yet be given. The
    following code uses concepts that will be explained later.

    Different systems have different ways to get started. But regardless of what
    conventions are adopted, the routine that initializes the terminal should
    satisfy the following specifications:

    \startitemize[n]

        \startitem
            It should open file |term_in| for input from the terminal. (The file
            |term_out| will already be open for output to the terminal.)
        \stopitem

        \startitem
            If the user has given a command line, this line should be considered
            the first line of terminal input. Otherwise the user should be
            prompted with `\.{**}', and the first line of input should be
            whatever is typed in response.
        \stopitem

        \startitem
            The first line of input, which might or might not be a command line,
            should appear in locations |first| to |last-1| of the |buffer| array.
        \stopitem

        \startitem
            The global variable |loc| should be set so that the character to be
            read next by \TeX\ is in |buffer[loc]|. This character should not be
            blank, and we should have |loc<last|.
        \stopitem

    \stopitemize

    It may be necessary to prompt the user several times before a non-blank line
    comes in. The prompt is `\.{**}' instead of the later `\.*' because the
    meaning is slightly different: `\.{\\input}' need not be typed immediately
    after~`\.{**}'.)

    The following program does the required initialization. Iff anything has been
    specified on the command line, then |t_open_in| will return with |last >
    first|.

    It's time now to fret about file names. Besides the fact that different
    operating systems treat files in different ways, we must cope with the fact
    that completely different naming conventions are used by different groups of
    people. The following programs show what is required for one particular
    operating system; similar routines for other systems are not difficult to
    devise.

    \TeX\ assumes that a file name has three parts: the name proper; its
    ``extension''; and a ``file area'' where it is found in an external file
    system. The extension of an input file or a write file is assumed to be
    `\.{.tex}' unless otherwise specified; it is `\.{.log}' on the transcript
    file that records each run of \TeX; it is `\.{.tfm}' on the font metric files
    that describe characters in the fonts \TeX\ uses; it is `\.{.dvi}' on the
    output files that specify typesetting information; and it is `\.{.fmt}' on
    the format files written by \.{INITEX} to initialize \TeX. The file area can
    be arbitrary on input files, but files are usually output to the user's
    current area. If an input file cannot be found on the specified area, \TeX\
    will look for it on a special system area; this special area is intended for
    commonly used input files like \.{webmac.tex}.

    Simple uses of \TeX\ refer only to file names that have no explicit extension
    or area. For example, a person usually says `\.{\\input} \.{paper}' or
    `\.{\\font\\tenrm} \.= \.{helvetica}' instead of `\.{\\input} \.{paper.new}'
    or `\.{\\font\\tenrm} \.= \.{<csd.knuth>test}'. Simple file names are best,
    because they make the \TeX\ source files portable; whenever a file name
    consists entirely of letters and digits, it should be treated in the same way
    by all implementations of \TeX. However, users need the ability to refer to
    other files in their environment, especially when responding to error
    messages concerning unopenable files; therefore we want to let them use the
    syntax that appears in their favorite operating system.

    The following procedures don't allow spaces to be part of file names; but
    some users seem to like names that are spaced-out. System-dependent changes
    to allow such things should probably be made with reluctance, and only when
    an entire file name that includes spaces is ``quoted'' somehow.

    Here are the global values that file names will be scanned into.

*/

/*tex name of file just scanned */

str_number cur_name;

/*tex file area just scanned, or \.{""} */

str_number cur_area;

/*tex file extension just scanned, or \.{""} */

str_number cur_ext;

/*tex

    The file names we shall deal with have the following structure: If the name
    contains `\./' or `\.:' (for Amiga only), the file area consists of all
    characters up to and including the final such character; otherwise the file
    area is null. If the remaining file name contains `\..', the file extension
    consists of all such characters from the last `\..' to the end, otherwise the
    file extension is null.

    We can scan such file names easily by using two global variables that keep
    track of the occurrences of area and extension delimiters:

*/

/*tex the most recent `\./', if any */

pool_pointer area_delimiter;

/*tex the relevant `\..', if any */

pool_pointer ext_delimiter;

/*tex

    Input files that can't be found in the user's area may appear in a standard
    system area called |TEX_area|. Font metric files whose areas are not given
    explicitly are assumed to appear in a standard system area called
    |TEX_font_area|. $\Omega$'s compiled translation process files whose areas
    are not given explicitly are assumed to appear in a standard system area.
    These system area names will, of course, vary from place to place.
