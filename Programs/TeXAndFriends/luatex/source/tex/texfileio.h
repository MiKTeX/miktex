The user's terminal acts essentially like other files of text, except
that it is used both for input and for output. When the terminal is
considered an input file, the file variable is called |term_in|, and when it
is considered an output file the file variable is |term_out|.

Here is how to open the terminal files.  |t_open_out| does nothing.
|t_open_in|, on the other hand, does the work of ``rescanning,'' or getting
any command line arguments the user has provided.  It's defined in C.

/*
Sometimes it is necessary to synchronize the input/output mixture that
happens on the user's terminal, and three system-dependent
procedures are used for this
purpose. The first of these, |update_terminal|, is called when we want
to make sure that everything we have output to the terminal so far has
actually left the computer's internal buffers and been sent.
The second, |clear_terminal|, is called when we wish to cancel any
input that the user may have typed ahead (since we are about to
issue an unexpected error message). The third, |wake_up_terminal|,
is supposed to revive the terminal if the user has disabled it by
some instruction to the operating system.  The following macros show how
these operations can be specified with {\mc UNIX}.  |update_terminal|
does an |fflush|. |clear_terminal| is redefined
to do nothing, since the user should control the terminal.
