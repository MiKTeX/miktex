    We come now to what is probably the most interesting algorithm of \TeX: the
    mechanism for choosing the ``best possible'' breakpoints that yield the
    individual lines of a paragraph. \TeX's line-breaking algorithm takes a given
    horizontal list and converts it to a sequence of boxes that are appended to
    the current vertical list. In the course of doing this, it creates a special
    data structure containing three kinds of records that are not used elsewhere
    in \TeX. Such nodes are created while a paragraph is being processed, and
    they are destroyed afterwards; thus, the other parts of \TeX\ do not need to
    know anything about how line-breaking is done.

    The method used here is based on an approach devised by Michael F. Plass and
    the author in 1977, subsequently generalized and improved by the same two
    people in 1980. A detailed discussion appears in {\sl SOFTWARE---Practice
    \AM\ Experience \bf11} (1981), 1119--1184, where it is shown that the
    line-breaking problem can be regarded as a special case of the problem of
    computing the shortest path in an acyclic network. The cited paper includes
    numerous examples and describes the history of line breaking as it has been
    practiced by printers through the ages. The present implementation adds two
    new ideas to the algorithm of 1980: Memory space requirements are
    considerably reduced by using smaller records for inactive nodes than for
    active ones, and arithmetic overflow is avoided by using ``delta distances''
    instead of keeping track of the total distance from the beginning of the
    paragraph to the current point.

    The |line_break| procedure should be invoked only in horizontal mode; it
    leaves that mode and places its output into the current vlist of the
    enclosing vertical mode (or internal vertical mode). There is one explicit
    parameter: |d| is true for partial paragraphs preceding display math mode; in
    this case the amount of additional penalty inserted before the final line is
    |display_widow_penalty| instead of |widow_penalty|.

    There are also a number of implicit parameters: The hlist to be broken starts
    at |vlink(head)|, and it is nonempty. The value of |prev_graf| in the
    enclosing semantic level tells where the paragraph should begin in the
    sequence of line numbers, in case hanging indentation or \.{\\parshape} are
    in use; |prev_graf| is zero unless this paragraph is being continued after a
    displayed formula. Other implicit parameters, such as the |par_shape_ptr| and
    various penalties to use for hyphenation, etc., appear in |eqtb|.

    After |line_break| has acted, it will have updated the current vlist and the
    value of |prev_graf|. Furthermore, the global variable |just_box| will point
    to the final box created by |line_break|, so that the width of this line can
    be ascertained when it is necessary to decide whether to use
    |above_display_skip| or |above_display_short_skip| before a displayed
    formula.

*/

/*tex The |hlist_node| for the last line of the new paragraph: */

halfword just_box;

/*tex

    In it's complete form, |line_break| is a rather lengthy procedure---sort of a
    small world unto itself---we must build it up little by little. Below you see
    only the general outline.

    The main task performed here is to move the list from |head| to |temp_head|
    and go into the enclosing semantic level. We also append the
    \.{\\parfillskip} glue to the end of the paragraph, removing a space (or
    other glue node) if it was there, since spaces usually precede blank lines
    and instances of `\.{\$\$}'. The |par_fill_skip| is preceded by an infinite
    penalty, so it will never be considered as a potential breakpoint.

    That code assumes that a |glue_node| and a |penalty_node| occupy the same
    number of |mem|~words.

    Most other processing is delegated to external functions.

    Another global variable called |threshold| is used to determine the
    feasibility of individual lines: breakpoints are feasible if there is a way

    badness is compared to |threshold| before penalties are added, so that

    The algorithm essentially determines the best possible way to achieve each
    feasible combination of position, line, and fitness. Thus, it answers
    questions like, ``What is the best way to break the opening part of the
    paragraph so that the fourth line is a tight line ending at such-and-such a
    place?'' However, the fact that all lines are to be the same length after a
    certain point makes it possible to regard all sufficiently large line numbers
    as equivalent, when the looseness parameter is zero, and this makes it
    possible for the algorithm to save space and time.

    An ``active node'' and a ``passive node'' are created in |mem| for each
    feasible breakpoint that needs to be considered. Active nodes are three words
    long and passive nodes are two words long. We need active nodes only for
    breakpoints near the place in the paragraph that is currently being examined,
    so they are recycled within a comparatively short time after they are
    created.

    An active node for a given breakpoint contains six fields:

    \startitemize[n]

        \startitem
            |vlink| points to the next node in the list of active nodes; the last
            active node has |vlink=active|.
        \stopitem

        \startitem
            |break_node| points to the passive node associated with this
            breakpoint.
        \stopitem

        \startitem
            |line_number| is the number of the line that follows this breakpoint.
        \stopitem

        \startitem
            |fitness| is the fitness classification of the line ending at this
            breakpoint.
        \stopitem

        \startitem
            |type| is either |hyphenated_node| or |unhyphenated_node|, depending

    The active list also contains ``delta'' nodes that help the algorithm compute
    the badness of individual lines. Such nodes appear only between two active
    nodes, and they have |type=delta_node|. If |p| and |r| are active nodes and
    if |q| is a delta node between them, so that |vlink(p)=q| and |vlink(q)=r|,
    then |q| tells the space difference between lines in the horizontal list that
    start after breakpoint |p| and lines that start after breakpoint |r|. In
    other words, if we know the length of the line that starts after |p| and ends
    at our current position, then the corresponding length of the line that
    starts after |r| is obtained by adding the amounts in node~|q|. A delta node
    contains seven scaled numbers, since it must record the net change in glue
    stretchability with respect to all orders of infinity. The natural width
    difference appears in |mem[q+1].sc|; the stretch differences in units of pt,
    sfi, fil, fill, and filll appear in |mem[q+2..q+6].sc|; and the shrink
    difference appears in |mem[q+7].sc|. The |subtype| field of a delta node is
    not used.

    Actually, we have two more fields that are used by |pdftex|.

    As the algorithm runs, it maintains a set of seven delta-like registers for
    the length of the line following the first active breakpoint to the current
    position in the given hlist. When it makes a pass through the active list, it
    also maintains a similar set of seven registers for the length following the
    active breakpoint of current interest. A third set holds the length of an
    empty line (namely, the sum of \.{\\leftskip} and \.{\\rightskip}); and a
    fourth set is used to create new delta nodes.

    When we pass a delta node we want to do operations like:

    \starttyping
    for k := 1 to 7 do
        cur_active_width[k] := cur_active_width[k] + mem[q+k].sc|};
    \stoptyping

    and we want to do this without the overhead of |for| loops. The |do_all_six|
    macro makes such six-tuples convenient.

    Let's state the principles of the delta nodes more precisely and concisely,
    so that the following programs will be less obscure. For each legal
    breakpoint~|p| in the paragraph, we define two quantities $\alpha(p)$ and
    $\beta(p)$ such that the length of material in a line from breakpoint~|p| to
    breakpoint~|q| is $\gamma+\beta(q)-\alpha(p)$, for some fixed $\gamma$.
    Intuitively, $\alpha(p)$ and $\beta(q)$ are the total length of material from
    the beginning of the paragraph to a point ``after'' a break at |p| and to a
    point ``before'' a break at |q|; and $\gamma$ is the width of an empty line,
    namely the length contributed by \.{\\leftskip} and \.{\\rightskip}.

    Suppose, for example, that the paragraph consists entirely of alternating
    boxes and glue skips; let the boxes have widths $x_1\ldots x_n$ and let the
    skips have widths $y_1\ldots y_n$, so that the paragraph can be represented
    by $x_1y_1\ldots x_ny_n$. Let $p_i$ be the legal breakpoint at $y_i$; then
    $\alpha(p_i)=x_1+y_1+\cdots+x_i+y_i$, and $\beta(p_i)= x_1+y_1+\cdots+x_i$.
    To check this, note that the length of material from $p_2$ to $p_5$, say, is
    $\gamma+x_3+y_3+x_4+y_4+x_5=\gamma+\beta(p_5) -\alpha(p_2)$.

    The quantities $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ involve glue stretchability and
    shrinkability as well as a natural width. If we were to compute $\alpha(p)$
    and $\beta(p)$ for each |p|, we would need multiple precision arithmetic, and
    the multiprecise numbers would have to be kept in the active nodes. \TeX\
    avoids this problem by working entirely with relative differences or
    ``deltas.'' Suppose, for example, that the active list contains
    $a_1\,\delta_1\,a_2\,\delta_2\,a_3$, where the |a|'s are active breakpoints
    and the $\delta$'s are delta nodes. Then $\delta_1=\alpha(a_1)-\alpha(a_2)$
    and $\delta_2=\alpha(a_2)-\alpha(a_3)$. If the line breaking algorithm is
    currently positioned at some other breakpoint |p|, the |active_width| array
    contains the value $\gamma+\beta(p)-\alpha(a_1)$. If we are scanning through
    the list of active nodes and considering a tentative line that runs from
    $a_2$ to~|p|, say, the |cur_active_width| array will contain the value
    $\gamma+\beta(p)-\alpha(a_2)$. Thus, when we move from $a_2$ to $a_3$, we
    want to add $\alpha(a_2)-\alpha(a_3)$ to |cur_active_width|; and this is just
    $\delta_2$, which appears in the active list between $a_2$ and $a_3$. The
    |background| array contains $\gamma$. The |break_width| array will be used to
    calculate values of new delta nodes when the active list is being updated.

    The heart of the line-breaking procedure is `|try_break|', a subroutine that
    tests if the current breakpoint |cur_p| is feasible, by running through the
    active list to see what lines of text can be made from active nodes
    to~|cur_p|. If feasible breaks are possible, new break nodes are created. If
    |cur_p| is too far from an active node, that node is deactivated.

    The parameter |pi| to |try_break| is the penalty associated with a break at
    |cur_p|; we have |pi=eject_penalty| if the break is forced, and
    |pi=inf_penalty| if the break is illegal.

    The other parameter, |break_type|, is set to |hyphenated_node| or
    |unhyphenated_node|, depending on whether or not the current break is at a
    |disc_node|. The end of a paragraph is also regarded as `|hyphenated_node|';
    this case is distinguishable by the condition |cur_p=null|.

    As we consider various ways to end a line at |cur_p|, in a given line number

    line breaks ending at |cur_p| with a |tight_fit| line;

            text. Then length of a line from |p| to |q| will be computed as
            $\gamma+\beta(q)-\alpha(|p|)$, where $\beta(q)=\beta(|p|)-l_0+l$. The
            actual length will be the background plus $l_1$, so the length from
            |p| to |p| should be $\gamma+l_0+l_1-l$. If the post-break text of
            the discretionary is empty, a break may also discard~|q|; in that
            unusual case we subtract the length of~|q| and any other nodes that
            will be discarded after the discretionary break.

            The value of $l_0$ need not be computed, since |line_break| will put
            it into the global variable |disc_width| before calling |try_break|.

            In case of nested discretionaries, we always follow the no-break
            path, as we are talking about the breaking on {\it this} position.
