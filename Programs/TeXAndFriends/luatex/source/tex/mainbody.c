This is where the action starts. We're speaking of \LUATEX, a continuation of
\PDFTEX\ (which included \ETEX) and \ALEPH. As \TEX, \LUATEX\ is a document
compiler intended to simplify high quality typesetting for many of the world's
languages. It is an extension of D. E. Knuth's \TEX, which was designed
essentially for the typesetting of languages using the Latin alphabet. Although
it is a direct decendant of \TEX, and therefore mostly compatible, there are
some subtle differences that relate to \UNICODE\ support and \OPENTYPE\ math.

The \ALEPH\ subsystem loosens many of the restrictions imposed by~\TeX: register
numbers are no longer limited to 8~bits. Fonts may have more than 256~characters,
more than 256~fonts may be used, etc. We use a similar model. We also borrowed
the directional model but have upgraded it a bit as well as integrated it more
tightly.

This program is directly derived from Donald E. Knuth's \TEX; the change history
which follows and the reward offered for finders of bugs refer specifically to
\TEX; they should not be taken as referring to \LUATEX, \PDFTEX, nor \ETEX,
although the change history is relevant in that it demonstrates the evolutionary
path followed. This program is not \TEX; that name is reserved strictly for the
program which is the creation and sole responsibility of Professor Knuth.

Although considerable effort has been expended to make the LuaTeX program correct
and reliable, no warranty is implied; the authors disclaim any obligation or
liability for damages, including but not limited to special, indirect, or
consequential damages arising out of or in connection with the use or performance
of this software. This work has been a ``labor of love'' and the authors hope
that users enjoy it.

{\em You will find a lot of comments that originate in original \TEX. We kept them
as a side effect of the conversion from \WEB\ to \CWEB. Because there is not much
webbing going on here eventually the files became regular \CCODE\ files with still
potentially typeset comments. As we add our own comments, and also comments are
there from \PDFTEX, \ALEPH\ and \ETEX, we get a curious mix. The best comments are
of course from Don Knuth. All bad comments are ours. All errors are ours too!

Not all comments make sense, because some things are implemented differently, for
instance some memory management. But the principles of tokens and nodes stayed.
It anyway means that you sometimes need to keep in mind that the explanation is
more geared to traditional \TEX. But that's not a bad thing. Sorry Don for any
confusion we introduced. The readers should have a copy of the \TEX\ books at hand
anyway.}

A large piece of software like \TeX\ has inherent complexity that cannot be
reduced below a certain level of difficulty, although each individual part is
fairly simple by itself. The \.{WEB} language is intended to make the algorithms
as readable as possible, by reflecting the way the individual program pieces fit
together and by providing the cross-references that connect different parts.
Detailed comments about what is going on, and about why things were done in
certain ways, have been liberally sprinkled throughout the program. These
comments explain features of the implementation, but they rarely attempt to
explain the \TeX\ language itself, since the reader is supposed to be familiar
with {\sl The \TeX book}.

The present implementation has a long ancestry, beginning in the summer of~1977,
when Michael~F. Plass and Frank~M. Liang designed and coded a prototype @^Plass,
Michael Frederick@> @^Liang, Franklin Mark@> @^Knuth, Donald Ervin@> based on
some specifications that the author had made in May of that year. This original
proto\TeX\ included macro definitions and elementary manipulations on boxes and
glue, but it did not have line-breaking, page-breaking, mathematical formulas,
alignment routines, error recovery, or the present semantic nest; furthermore, it
used character lists instead of token lists, so that a control sequence like
\.{\\halign} was represented by a list of seven characters. A complete version of
\TeX\ was designed and coded by the author in late 1977 and early 1978; that
program, like its prototype, was written in the {\mc SAIL} language, for which an
excellent debugging system was available. Preliminary plans to convert the {\mc
SAIL} code into a form somewhat like the present ``web'' were developed by Luis
Trabb~Pardo and @^Trabb Pardo, Luis Isidoro@> the author at the beginning of
1979, and a complete implementation was created by Ignacio~A. Zabala in 1979 and
1980. The \TeX82 program, which @^Zabala Salelles, Ignacio Andr\'es@> was written
by the author during the latter part of 1981 and the early part of 1982, also
incorporates ideas from the 1979 implementation of @^Guibas, Leonidas Ioannis@>
@^Sedgewick, Robert@> @^Wyatt, Douglas Kirk@> \TeX\ in {\mc MESA} that was
written by Leonidas Guibas, Robert Sedgewick, and Douglas Wyatt at the Xerox Palo
Alto Research Center. Several hundred refinements were introduced into \TeX82
based on the experiences gained with the original implementations, so that
essentially every part of the system has been substantially improved. After the
appearance of ``Version 0'' in September 1982, this program benefited greatly
from the comments of many other people, notably David~R. Fuchs and Howard~W.
Trickey. A final revision in September 1989 extended the input character set to
eight-bit codes and introduced the ability to hyphenate words from different
languages, based on some ideas of Michael~J. Ferguson. @^Fuchs, David Raymond@>
@^Trickey, Howard Wellington@> @^Ferguson, Michael John@>

No doubt there still is plenty of room for improvement, but the author is firmly
committed to keeping \TeX82 ``frozen'' from now on; stability and reliability are
to be its main virtues.
On the other hand, the \.{WEB} description can be extended without changing the
core of \TeX82 itself, and the program has been designed so that such extensions
are not extremely difficult to make. The |banner| string defined here should be
changed whenever \TeX\ undergoes any modifications, so that it will be clear
which version of \TeX\ might be the guilty party when a problem arises.
@^extensions to \TeX@> @^system dependencies@>

This program contains code for various features extending \TeX, therefore this
program is called `\eTeX' and not `\TeX'; the official name `\TeX' by itself is
reserved for software systems that are fully compatible with each other. A
special test suite called the ``\.{TRIP} test'' is available for helping to
determine whether a particular implementation deserves to be known as `\TeX'
[cf.~Stanford Computer Science report CS1027, November 1984].

A similar test suite called the ``\.{e-TRIP} test'' is available for helping to
determine whether a particular implementation deserves to be known as `\eTeX'.

This is the first of many sections of \TeX\ where global variables are defined.

This is it: the part of \TeX\ that executes all those procedures we have written.

We have noted that there are two versions of \TeX82. One, called \.{INITEX},
@.INITEX@> has to be run first; it initializes everything from scratch, without
reading a format file, and it has the capability of dumping a format file. The
other one is called `\.{VIRTEX}'; it is a ``virgin'' program that needs
@.VIRTEX@> to input a format file in order to get started.

For \LUATEX\ it is important to know that we still dump a format. But, in order
to gain speed and a smaller footprint, we gzip the format (level 3). We also
store some information that makes an abort possible in case of an incompatible
engine version, which is important as \LUATEX\ develops. It is possible to store
\LUA\ code in the format but not the current upvalues so you still need to
initialize. Also, traditional fonts are stored, as are extended fonts but any
additional information needed for instance to deal with \OPENTYPE\ fonts is to be
handled by \LUA\ code and therefore not present in the format.

Here we do whatever is needed to complete \TeX's job gracefully on the local
operating system. The code here might come into play after a fatal error; it must
therefore consist entirely of ``safe'' operations that cannot produce error
messages. For example, it would be a mistake to call |str_room| or |make_string|
at this time, because a call on |overflow| might lead to an infinite loop.
@^system dependencies@>

Actually there's one way to get error messages, via |prepare_mag|; but that can't
cause infinite recursion. @^recursion@>

This program doesn't bother to close the input files that may still be open.
