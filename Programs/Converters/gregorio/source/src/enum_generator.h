/* These macros are used for generating enum code.  This is based on the
 * technique described in http://stackoverflow.com/a/202511
 *
 * Two of these macros are meant for use outside this set of macros:
 *
 * - ENUM declares the enum itself and a prototype for the function that
 *   returns the string value of the enum's numeric value.  This is meant to be
 *   used from a header file.
 * - ENUM_TO_STRING defines the function whose prototype was declared by ENUM.
 *   This is meant to be used from a code file.
 *
 * These two macros both take the following two arguments:
 *
 * - TYPE is the name to use for the enum.
 * - DEF is the name of a macro that generates the bodies of the enum and the
 *   to-string function.  DEF should take four arguments, in the following
 *   order (with suggested names):
 *   - A is a macro that generates an enum value with a specifiec numeric
 *     value.  It takes two arguments, the name and the numeric value.
 *   - E is a macro that generates an enum value that has no specific numeric
 *     value.  It takes one argument, the name.
 *   - X is a macro that generates the last enum value when it has a specific
 *     numeric value.  It takes the same two arguments as A.
 *   - L is a macro that generates the last enum value when it has no specific
 *     numeric value.  It takes the same argument as E.
 *
 *  Note: If we were supporting C11, we could take empty macro arguments and
 *  would be able to get away with only two arguments to DEF.
