NOTE:  because of the casts put in the macros for Loc, ArcCA, Conic,
RoundConic, PathSegment, and JoinSegment, we cannot use the macro names
when the functions are actually defined.  We have to use the unique
names with their unique first two characters.  Thus, if anyone in the
future ever decided to change the first two characters, it would not be
enough just to change the macro (as it would for most other functions).
He would have to also change the function definition.

:h2.Path Segment Structures
 
A path is represented as a linked list of the following structure:
*/
 
/*SHARED LINE(S) ORIGINATED HERE*/
/*
When 'link' is NULL, we are at the last segment in the path (surprise!).
 
'last' is only non-NULL on the first segment of a path,
for all the other segments 'last' == NULL.  We test for a non-NULL
'last' (ISPATHANCHOR predicate) when we are given an alleged path
to make sure the user is not trying to pull a fast one on us.
 
A path may be a collection of disjoint paths.  Every break in the
disjoint path is represented by a MOVETYPE segment.
 
Closed paths are discussed in :hdref refid=close..
 
:h3.CopyPath() - Physically Duplicating a Path
 
This simple function illustrates moving through the path linked list.
Duplicating a segment just involves making a copy of it, except for
text, which has some auxilliary things involved.  We don't feel
competent to duplicate text in this module, so we call someone who
knows how (in the FONTS module).

/*
:h2 id=location."location" Objects
 
The TYPE1IMAGER user creates and destroys objects of type "location".  These
objects locate points for the primitive path operators.  We play a trick
here and store these objects in the same "segment" structure used for
paths, with a type field == MOVETYPE.
 
This allows the Line() operator, for example, to be very trivial:
It merely stamps its input structure as a LINETYPE and returns it to the
caller--assuming, of course, the input structure was not permanent (as
it usually isn't).

We need more points to describe curves.  So, the structures for curved

:h3.Bezier Segment Structure
 
We support third order Bezier curves.  They are specified with four
control points A, B, C, and D.  The curve starts at A with slope AB
and ends at D with slope CD.  The curvature at the point A is inversely
related to the length |AB|, and the curvature at the point D is
inversely related to the length |CD|.  Point A is always point (0,0).

:h2.Transforming and Putting Handles on Paths

Transforming a path involves transforming all the points.  In order
that closed paths do not become "unclosed" when their relative
positions are slightly changed due to loss of arithmetic precision,
all point transformations are in absolute coordinates.
 
(It might be better to reset the "absolute" coordinates every time a
move segment is encountered.  This would mean that we could accumulate
error from subpath to subpath, but we would be less likely to make
the "big error" where our fixed point arithmetic "wraps".  However, I
think I'll keep it this way until something happens to convince me
otherwise.)
 
The transform is described as a "space", that way we can use our
old friend the "iconvert" function, which should be very efficient.
