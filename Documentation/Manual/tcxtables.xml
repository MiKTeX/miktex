<para><emphasis>This section is <quote>borrowed</quote> from the
<acronym>Web2C</acronym> manual.</emphasis></para>

<para>&TCX; (&TeX; character translation) files help &TeX; support
direct input of 8-bit international characters if fonts containing
those characters are being used.  Specifically, they map an input
(keyboard) character code to the internal &TeX; character code (a
superset of <acronym>ASCII</acronym>).</para>

<para>Of the various proposals for handling more than one input
encoding, &TCX; files were chosen because they follow Knuth's original
ideas for the use of the <varname>xchr</varname> and
<varname>xord</varname> tables.  He ventured that these would be
changed in the <acronym>WEB</acronym> source in order to adjust the
actual version to a given environment.  It turned out, however, that
recompiling the <acronym>WEB</acronym> sources is not as simple task
as Knuth predicted; therefore, &TCX; files, providing the possibility
of changing of the conversion tables on on-the-fly, has been
implemented instead.</para>

<para>This approach limits the portability of &TeX; documents, as some
implementations do not support it (or use a different method for
input-internal reencoding).  It may also be problematic to determine
the encoding to use for a &TeX; document of unknown provenance; in the
worst case, failure to do so correctly may result in subtle errors in
the typeset output.</para>

<para>While &TCX; files can be used with any format, using them breaks
the &LaTeX; <varname>inputenc</varname> package.  This is why you
should either use <emphasis>tcxfile</emphasis> or
<emphasis>inputenc</emphasis> in &LaTeX; input files, but never
both.</para>

<para>This is entirely independent of the <application>MLTeX</application>
<indexterm>
<primary>MLTeX</primary>
</indexterm>
extension: whereas a &TCX; file defines how an input keyboard
character is mapped to &TeX;'s internal code,
<application>MLTeX</application> defines substitutions for a
non-existing character glyph in a font with a <markup
role="tex">\accent</markup> construction made out of two separate
character glyphs.  &TCX; files involve no new primitives; it is not
possible to specify that an input (keyboard) character maps to more
than one character.</para>

<para>Specifying &TCX; files:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>You can specify a &TCX; file to be used for a
particular &TeX; run by specifying the command-line option
<option>-translate-file=<replaceable>tcxfile</replaceable></option> or
(preferably) specifying it explicitly in the first line of the main
document:
<programlisting>%&amp; -translate-file=<replaceable>tcxfile</replaceable></programlisting>
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>&TCX; files are searched for along the <envar>TCXPath</envar> path.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><command>initex</command> ignores &TCX; files.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>&MiKTeX; comes with at least two &TCX; files,
<filename>il1-t1.tcx</filename> and <filename>il2-t1.tcx</filename>.
These support <acronym>ISO</acronym> Latin&nbsp;1 and
<acronym>ISO</acronym> Latin&nbsp;2, respectively, with Cork-encoded fonts
<indexterm>
<primary>Cork encoding and ISO input</primary>
</indexterm>
<indexterm>
<primary>T1 encoding and <acronym>ISO</acronym> input</primary>
</indexterm>
(a.k.a.: the T1 encoding).  &TCX; files for Czech, Polish, and Slovak
are also provided.</para>

<para>Syntax of &TCX; files:</para>

<orderedlist>

<listitem><para>Line-oriented.  Blank lines are ignored.</para></listitem>
    
<listitem><para>Whitespace is ignored except as a separator.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Comments start with <userinput>%</userinput> and
continue to the end of the line.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Otherwise, a line consists of one or two character codes:
<programlisting><replaceable>src</replaceable> [<replaceable>dest</replaceable>]</programlisting></para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Each character code may be specified in octal with a
leading <literal>0</literal>, hexadecimal with a leading
<literal>0x</literal>, or decimal otherwise.  Values must be between
<literal>0</literal> and <literal>255</literal>, inclusive (decimal).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If the <replaceable>dest</replaceable> code is not
specified, it is taken to be the same as
<replaceable>src</replaceable>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If the same <replaceable>src</replaceable> code is
specified more than once, it is the last definition that
counts.</para></listitem>

</orderedlist>

<para>Finally, here's what happens: when &TeX; sees an input character
with code <replaceable>src</replaceable>: it 1)&nbsp;changes
<replaceable>src</replaceable> to <replaceable>dest</replaceable>; and
2)&nbsp;makes code the <replaceable>dest</replaceable>
<quote>printable</quote>, i.e., printed as-is in diagnostics and the
log file instead of in <computeroutput>^^</computeroutput>
notation.</para>

<para>By default, no characters are translated, and character codes
between <literal>32</literal> and <literal>126</literal> inclusive
(decimal) are printable.  It is not possible to make these (or any)
characters unprintable.</para>

<para>Specifying translations for the printable
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters (codes
<literal>32</literal>&ndash;<literal>127</literal>) will yield
unpredictable results.  Additionally you shouldn't make the following
characters printable: <userinput>^^I</userinput>
(<abbrev>TAB</abbrev>), <userinput>^^J</userinput> (line feed),
<userinput>^^M</userinput> (carriage return), and
<userinput>^^?</userinput> (delete), since &TeX; uses them in various
ways.</para>

<para>Thus, the idea is to specify the input (keyboard) character code
for <replaceable>src</replaceable>, and the output (font) character
code for <replaceable>dest</replaceable>.</para>
