    <TPM:Description>
      Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output
      devices. Currently supported output targets include the X Window
      System (via both Xlib and XCB), Quartz, Win32, image buffers,
      PostScript, PDF, and SVG file output. Experimental backends
      include OpenGL, BeOS, OS/2, and DirectFB.
      
      Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output
      media while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration
      when available (eg. through the X Render Extension).
      
      The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing
      operators of PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo including
      stroking and filling cubic Bézier splines, transforming and
      compositing translucent images, and antialiased text
      rendering. All drawing operations can be transformed by any
      affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.)
      
      Cairo is implemented as a library written in the C programming
      language, but bindings are available for several different
      programming languages.
