    <TPM:Description>
      Graphite is a system that can be used to create “smart fonts”
      capable of displaying writing systems with various complex
      behaviors. A smart font contains not only letter shapes but also
      additional instructions indicating how to combine and position
      the letters in complex ways.
      
      Graphite was primarily developed to provide the flexibility
      needed for minority languages which often need to be written
      according to slightly different rules than well-known languages
      that use the same script.
