    <TPM:Description>
      autosp is a preprocessor that generates note-spacing commands
      for MusiXTeX scores. It simplifies the creation of MusiXTeX
      scores by converting (non-standard) commands of the form \anotes
      ... \en into one or more conventional note-spacing commands, as
      determined by the note values themselves, with \sk spacing
      commands inserted as necessary.  The coding for an entire
      measure can be entered one part at a time, without concern for
      note-spacing changes within the part or spacing requirements of
      other parts.

      Included in the autosp package is a small utility rebar that
      reads a MusiXTeX score and generates a copy with bar-number
      comments of the form %barno appended to commands such as \bar,
      \alaligne, etc. replacing any existing comments.  Bar-numbering
      in the MusiXTeX output is not affected.
