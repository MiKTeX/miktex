      GD is an open source code library for the dynamic creation of
      images by programmers. GD is written in C, and "wrappers" are
      available for Perl, PHP and other languages. GD creates PNG,
      JPEG, GIF, WebP, XPM, BMP images, among other formats. GD is
      commonly used to generate charts, graphics, thumbnails, and most
      anything else, on the fly. While not restricted to use on the
      web, the most common applications of GD involve website
      development.
      
      The library was originally developped by Thomas Boutell and is
      now maintained by Pierre Joye under the umbrella of PHP.net.
